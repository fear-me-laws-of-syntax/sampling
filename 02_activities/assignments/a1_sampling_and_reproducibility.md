# ASSIGNMENT: Sampling and Reproducibility in Python

Read the blog post [Contact tracing can give a biased sample of COVID-19 cases](https://andrewwhitby.com/2020/11/24/contact-tracing-biased/) by Andrew Whitby to understand the context and motivation behind the simulation model we will be examining.

Examine the code in `whitby_covid_tracing.py`. Identify all stages at which sampling is occurring in the model. Describe in words the sampling procedure, referencing the functions used, sample size, sampling frame, any underlying distributions involved, and how these relate to the procedure outlined in the blog post.

Run the Python script file called whitby_covid_tracing.py as is and compare the results to the graphs in the original blog post. Does this code appear to reproduce the graphs from the original blog post?

Modify the number of repetitions in the simulation to 100 (from the original 1000). Run the script multiple times and observe the outputted graphs. Comment on the reproducibility of the results.

Alter the code so that it is reproducible. Describe the changes you made to the code and how they affected the reproducibility of the script file. The output does not need to match Whitbyâ€™s original blogpost/graphs, it just needs to produce the same output when run multiple times

CODE CHANGES:

1. Make sure the code result is reproducible every time it's run:
Set a random seed, np.random.seed(111) at the start to ensure the random choices are the same every time the code runs (same people get infected, same people get traced, same proportions for weddings vs. brunches)

2. Reduce simulations from 1000 to 100:
The script runs faster, but results may be more variable because of the smaller sample size. But since we locked the random seed, the result will always be the same every time the code runs.



STAGES OF SAMPLING:

1. Initial population assignment (deterministic)
Function: pd.DataFrame
Sampling frame: weddings: 200 attendees (2 weddings of 100 each); brunches: 800 attendees (80 brunches of 10 each).
Sample size: 1000 attendees
Distribution: deterministic allocation based on predefined event proportions.
Relation to blog: matches Whitbyâ€™s explicit description of event types and sizes.

2. Infection sampling (random infection assignment)
Function: np.random.choice
Sampling frame: all 1000 attendees
Sample size: 10% of infected (100 people randomly)
Distribution: binomial distribution approximation, implemented as simple random sampling without replacement.
Relation to blog: matches Whitbyâ€™s assumption that each attendee independently has a fixed probability of infection.

3. Primary contact tracing (random tracing selection)
Function: np.random.rand
Sampling frame: infected attendees (100 people)
Sample size: approx 20% of infected cases (20 people)
Distribution: bernoulli distribution (each infected attendee independently has 20% chance of being traced).
Relation to blog: Whitby mentions resource limitations meaning only some infected people are initially traced.

4. Secondary contact tracing (conditional sampling)
Functions: pandas conditional selection (logical indexing)
Sampling frame: events with at least 2 traced infected attendees.
Sample size: deterministic â€” all infected attendees from triggered events.
Distribution: conditional deterministic inclusion based on event-level infection counts.
Relation to blog: represents Whitbyâ€™s core argument about biased tracing towards larger events (weddings).

5. Ensuring reproducibility
Function: np.random.seed()
Reason: to fix randomness to obtain identical results across runs.
Relation to blog: improves reproducibility, ensuring consistent analysis results, independent from Whitby's simulation runs.
