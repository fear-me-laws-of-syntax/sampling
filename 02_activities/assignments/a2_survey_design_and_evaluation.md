# Assignment: Questionnaire Design and Sample Evaluation

## Requirements

The goal of this assignment is to practice developing and evaluating sampling materials.

### Part A - Survey Design:

Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1. In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2. Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3. Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.

##### Scenarios

1. You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2. You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3. You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.

Scenario 1.

1. Survey purpose:
   To understand why many entry- and lower-level employees leave the company. To examine such factors as job satisfaction, workload, company culture, pay, career growth opportunities, work-life balance etc.
   Gathering feedback will help the company to discover key issues and make changes to improve employee satisfaction and retention.

2. Target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.

Target population:
Entry- and lower-level company employees (those who currently work for the company, and those who recently left).

Sampling frame:
A subset of the target population employees that includes both, current employees who have been with the company for at least 1 month (50%), and former employees who left within the past 6 months (50%).

Sampling units:
Individual employees who match the criteria of the sampling frame.

Sampling strategy:
Two-stage sampling. Employees will be grouped into stratas (to represent all company's departments). Then we will randomly select a proportional to the size of each depertmant number of employees from each department.

This will ensure a broad range of diverse responses, and keep the survey representative of the overall employee situation within all departments. The survey is aimed to be anonymous.

### Part B - Survey Evaluation:

For the **Canadian General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (cycle 33)**, conducted by Statistics Canada find any and all available documentation for the data gathered and identify and describe the survey features indicated below.

## Part B - Survey Evaluation:

1. Sample type:
   Stratified probability sampling
2. Sample size:
   50,000
3. Target population:
   People aged 15 and older, residing in private households across the 10 Canadian provinces, excluding the three territories.
4. Sampling frame
   Landline and mobile phone numbers obtained through Statistics Canada.
5. Survey mode(s)
   Electronic Questionnaire or CATI (computer assisted telephone interviewing).
6. Timeline
   Sept 4 - Dec 28, 2018
7. Response rate
   41.9%
8. Weights
   Weights adjusted for unequal selection, non-response, and Census demographics to ensure representation of Canadians aged 15+.
9. Data processing
   Data quality ensured through control measures, response standardization, and accuracy verification.
10. Cleaning, imputation, etc
    Cleaning: applying computer edits throughout the interviews via CATI, ensuring proper questionnaire flow and flagging outlier values.
    Imputation: missing data was mainly filled using a donor-based method, where records with similar characteristics were matched using a scoring system. The record with the highest score provided the missing information. If multiple records had the same high score, one was chosen randomly. When donor matching wasnâ€™t possible, missing values were replaced by the average from a group of similar records.
11. Sources of error
    Sampling errors: results may vary due to randomness of the selection.
    Measurement errors: may happen if participants misunderstood the questions.
12. Limitations, known biases, etc
    Limitation due to exclusion of 3 Canadian territories.
    Non-response bias - if the type of people who did answer is different from those who didn't.
